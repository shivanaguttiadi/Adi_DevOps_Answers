**Python_ Scripting**

Of course! Here are some questions and answers related to Python scripting:

1. **What is Python scripting?**
   - Answer: Python scripting refers to writing Python code to automate tasks or perform specific actions. It involves creating Python scripts that can be executed to achieve desired functionalities.

2. **What are some common use cases for Python scripting?**
   - Answer: Python scripting is commonly used for tasks such as file manipulation, data processing, web scraping, automation of repetitive tasks, system administration, and more.

3. **How do you execute a Python script?**
   - Answer: Python scripts can be executed using the `python` command followed by the script filename, like `python script.py`. Additionally, on Unix-like systems, you can add a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python`) at the beginning of the script and make the script executable using `chmod +x script.py`, allowing it to be run directly.

4. **What is the purpose of `if __name__ == "__main__":` in Python scripts?**
   - Answer: This construct is used to check if the script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module into another script. Code inside this block will only execute if the script is the main program.

5. **How can you handle command-line arguments in Python scripts?**
   - Answer: You can use the `sys.argv` list or the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments. `sys.argv` provides access to the command-line arguments passed to the script, while `argparse` offers a more feature-rich way to parse and handle command-line arguments.

6. **Explain the purpose of shebang (`#!`) in Python scripts.**
   - Answer: The shebang line at the beginning of a Python script (`#!/usr/bin/env python`) specifies the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. It allows the script to be run directly from the command line without explicitly calling the Python interpreter.

7. **How do you read and write files in Python scripts?**
   - Answer: You can use the built-in `open()` function to read from and write to files. For reading, you can use modes like `'r'` for reading, `'w'` for writing, `'a'` for appending, and more.

8. **What is the purpose of virtual environments in Python scripting?**
   - Answer: Virtual environments isolate Python environments and dependencies for different projects, preventing conflicts between project dependencies. They allow you to create project-specific environments with their own packages and versions.

9. **How do you handle exceptions in Python scripts?**
   - Answer: Exceptions in Python scripts can be handled using `try` and `except` blocks. Code that may raise exceptions is placed inside the `try` block, and any potential exceptions are caught and handled in the `except` block.

10. **Explain the role of `__init__.py` files in Python scripts.**
    - Answer: The `__init__.py` files are used to define packages in Python. They can be empty or contain initialization code that runs when the package is imported. These files indicate to Python that the directory should be treated as a package.

Certainly! Here are more questions and answers related to Python scripting:

11. **What are some common data structures used in Python scripting?**
    - Answer: Common data structures in Python include lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings. Each has its own characteristics and use cases, such as lists for ordered collections, dictionaries for key-value mappings, and sets for unordered collections of unique elements.

12. **How can you handle errors and exceptions in Python scripts?**
    - Answer: Errors and exceptions in Python can be handled using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block is used to enclose code that may raise exceptions, while the `except` block catches and handles specific exceptions or all exceptions. The `else` block executes if no exceptions occur, and the `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.

13. **Explain the difference between `==` and `is` operators in Python.**
    - Answer: The `==` operator checks for equality of values, comparing the contents of objects. On the other hand, the `is` operator checks for identity, verifying if two objects refer to the same memory location. While `==` compares values, `is` compares object identities.

14. **What is a generator in Python, and how is it different from a regular function?**
    - Answer: A generator in Python is a special type of iterator that generates values lazily, on-demand, using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`. Generators allow for efficient memory usage and are useful for handling large datasets or infinite sequences. Unlike regular functions, generators maintain their state between function calls, allowing them to resume execution from where they left off.

15. **How do you handle module imports in Python scripts?**
    - Answer: Module imports in Python scripts are done using the `import` statement followed by the module name. Additionally, you can use `from module import function` to import specific functions or variables from a module. Python searches for modules in directories listed in the `sys.path` variable.

16. **Explain the concept of list comprehensions in Python.**
    - Answer: List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python by iterating over an iterable and applying an expression to each element. They have the form `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`, where the condition is optional. List comprehensions offer a more readable and compact alternative to traditional for loops when creating lists.

17. **What is the purpose of the `__name__` variable in Python scripts?**
    - Answer: The `__name__` variable in Python scripts is a special variable that stores the name of the current module. When a script is executed as the main program, `__name__` is set to `'__main__'`. This allows the script to determine if it is being run as the main program or imported as a module into another script.

18. **How can you handle command-line arguments in Python scripts?**
    - Answer: Command-line arguments in Python scripts can be handled using the `sys.argv` list, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script. Alternatively, you can use the `argparse` module to parse and handle command-line arguments in a more structured and user-friendly way.

19. **Explain the concept of lambda functions in Python and provide an example.**
    - Answer: Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, inline functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can take any number of arguments but can only have a single expression. Lambda functions are commonly used in situations where a small function is needed for a short duration. For example:
    ```python
    square = lambda x: x ** 2
    print(square(5))  # Output: 25
    ```

20. **What is the purpose of the `with` statement in Python, and how is it used?**
    - Answer: The `with` statement in Python is used to ensure that certain resources are properly managed and released, such as files or database connections. It provides a more concise and readable way to work with such resources by automatically handling the setup and teardown operations. The `with` statement is commonly used with the `open()` function to work with files in a safe and efficient manner.

**Script Level**

1. **Scenario: You have a text file containing a list of email addresses, and you need to extract all unique domains from these addresses using a Python script. How would you approach this task?**

   ```python
   # Python script to extract unique domains from a list of email addresses
   
   def extract_domains(file_path):
       domains = set()
       with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
           for line in file:
               email = line.strip()
               domain = email.split('@')[-1]
               domains.add(domain)
       return domains

   # Usage example
   file_path = 'email_list.txt'
   unique_domains = extract_domains(file_path)
   print(unique_domains)
   ```

   **Answer:** This Python script defines a function `extract_domains` that takes a file path as input, reads each line from the file, extracts the domain part of each email address, and adds it to a set to ensure uniqueness. Finally, it returns the set of unique domains.

2. **Scenario: You have a CSV file containing employee data with columns for name, department, and salary. You need to filter out employees from the 'Engineering' department who earn more than $100,000 per year and save their information to a new CSV file. How would you accomplish this task using Python?**

   ```python
   # Python script to filter employee data based on department and salary
   
   import csv

   def filter_employees(input_file, output_file):
       with open(input_file, 'r') as f_in, open(output_file, 'w', newline='') as f_out:
           reader = csv.DictReader(f_in)
           writer = csv.DictWriter(f_out, fieldnames=reader.fieldnames)
           writer.writeheader()
           for row in reader:
               if row['Department'] == 'Engineering' and float(row['Salary']) > 100000:
                   writer.writerow(row)

   # Usage example
   input_file = 'employee_data.csv'
   output_file = 'engineering_high_salary.csv'
   filter_employees(input_file, output_file)
   ```

   **Answer:** This Python script defines a function `filter_employees` that takes the input CSV file path and output CSV file path as input. It reads each row from the input file, checks if the employee belongs to the 'Engineering' department and earns more than $100,000 per year, and writes the filtered rows to a new CSV file.

3. **Scenario: You have a directory containing multiple text files, and you need to find and count the occurrences of a specific word in each file. How would you implement this task using Python?**

   ```python
   # Python script to count occurrences of a word in multiple text files
   
   import os

   def count_word_occurrences(directory, word):
       word_count = {}
       for filename in os.listdir(directory):
           if filename.endswith('.txt'):
               with open(os.path.join(directory, filename), 'r') as file:
                   text = file.read()
                   count = text.lower().count(word.lower())
                   word_count[filename] = count
       return word_count

   # Usage example
   directory = 'text_files'
   word = 'Python'
   occurrences = count_word_occurrences(directory, word)
   print(occurrences)
   ```

   **Answer:** This Python script defines a function `count_word_occurrences` that takes a directory path and a word as input. It iterates over each text file in the directory, reads the contents, and counts the occurrences of the specified word (case-insensitive). Finally, it returns a dictionary mapping file names to word counts.
