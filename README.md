Absolutely! Here are the answers with more visually appealing symbols for a GitHub README:

1. **Stopping vs. Terminating an EC2 Instance**:
   - ⏸️ Stopping an instance is like putting it on pause; it retains its configuration, data, and associated resources (like Elastic IPs). ⛔ Terminating an instance, on the other hand, is like shutting it down permanently; it removes all data, configurations, and associated resources.
   
2. **Adding an Existing Instance to a New Auto Scaling Group**:
   - 🔄 You can't directly add an existing instance to a new Auto Scaling group. Instead, you can create a new launch configuration for the Auto Scaling group with the same configuration as the existing instance, then update the Auto Scaling group to use the new launch configuration.

3. **Configuring CloudWatch to Recover an EC2 Instance**:
   - ☁️ You can configure CloudWatch to recover an EC2 instance by setting up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor instance health or system status checks. Then, configure the alarm to trigger an action, such as recovering the instance, when certain conditions are met.

4. **Difference between Latency Based Routing and Geo DNS**:
   - 🌐 Latency Based Routing directs traffic based on the lowest network latency to the user. 📍 Geo DNS directs traffic based on the user's geographical location. While both aim to optimize performance, Latency Based Routing focuses on network latency, whereas Geo DNS focuses on geographic proximity.
