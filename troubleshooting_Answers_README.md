1. **My application suddenly stopped working? Explain the process to resolve this issue.**
   - **Answer:** When an application suddenly stops working, it's essential to first check the application logs for any error messages or exceptions. Next, inspect the system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage) to identify any resource constraints. If necessary, restart the application service or server instance. If the issue persists, escalate to the development team for further investigation and debugging.

2. **My EC2 disk space is getting full for Linux? How to increase disk space?**
   - **Answer:** To increase disk space on an EC2 instance running Linux, you can resize the EBS volume associated with the instance. First, stop the instance, then modify the volume size in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI. After resizing, start the instance and use commands like `resize2fs` or `xfs_growfs` to extend the file system to utilize the additional space.

3. **Auto Scaling is not working as expected? Which parameter needs to be checked?**
   - **Answer:** When Auto Scaling is not working as expected, check the Auto Scaling Group configuration in the AWS Management Console. Ensure that the desired capacity, minimum and maximum size settings, launch configuration, and scaling policies are correctly configured. Additionally, inspect CloudWatch alarms associated with the Auto Scaling Group to identify any triggers or anomalies.

4. **My application is working very slowly? How to fix it and what things to check?**
   - **Answer:** Slow application performance can be caused by various factors such as high CPU or memory usage, database bottlenecks, network latency, or inefficient code. Begin by monitoring system metrics and application logs to identify the root cause. Optimize database queries, implement caching mechanisms, tune server configurations, and consider scaling resources horizontally or vertically to improve performance.

5. **AWS account bills are huge, how to control the infrastructure cost?**
   - **Answer:** To control AWS infrastructure costs, start by analyzing the cost breakdown in the AWS Cost Explorer or Billing Dashboard. Identify cost drivers such as EC2 instances, S3 storage, data transfer, etc. Implement cost-saving measures like using reserved instances, rightsizing resources, enabling auto scaling, leveraging spot instances, and optimizing storage usage.

6. **AWS bill suddenly increases. Explain the process to figure out the root cause.**
   - **Answer:** When an AWS bill suddenly increases, review the detailed billing report or cost allocation tags to identify which services or resources have experienced cost spikes. Analyze usage patterns, recent deployments, and changes in resource configurations. Investigate any unexpected data transfer, storage usage, or provisioned services. Engage with AWS support for further assistance if necessary.

7. **After deployment, the application is not working. How to roll back to the last stable version in Jenkins?**
   - **Answer:** To roll back to the last stable version in Jenkins, navigate to the Jenkins job that performed the deployment. Find the last successful build or deployment, and locate the corresponding artifact or release version. Trigger the rollback by selecting the previous stable version from the artifacts or version control system and initiating the deployment process again.
